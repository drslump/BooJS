Overview
========

BooJs allows to compile Boo source code into JavaScript code for its execution
in browsers and other JavaScript environments like Node.js.


Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~

Developing large code bases with JavaScript is hard, even with the current set
of tools and frameworks there are just so many times when a statically typed
language would find subtle bugs at the compiling stage instead of when testing.
Moreover, people from many different backgrounds are put together to develop
large applications and not all of them embrace or are trained in using the good
parts of the language. The situation is somewhat improved by the use of languages
like CoffeeScript, although for the overhead of adding a compilation step they
don't offer much more than a nicer syntax. Boo is great because it will not only
give you a nicer, more structured syntax but also has a pretty intelligent
compiler to help you in your development.
